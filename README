Based on what Vim detects you are running, allows for Unix or WinNT based Clearcase.  Script will setup command-line abbreviations to shortcut checking-in/out, uncheckout, list checkouts (current directory, recurse directories, or all vobs), list version history.  Also sets up a Clearcase Menu if you are running a gui version of Vim, which provides the same operations.
